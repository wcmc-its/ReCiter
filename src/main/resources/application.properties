###Spring configuration ###
##This is to make sure bean oveririding is true since relase of 2.1.0 bean overriding is by default false. 
##For more details see - https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.1-Release-Notes
spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true

##Spring Security configuration##
spring.security.enabled=true


#### Server configuration ####

## Server port. You can override this by passing your port using environment variable SERVER_PORT.
server.port=5000


#### Database configuration ####
aws.dynamodb.settings.table.create=true
aws.dynamodb.settings.table.readcapacityunits=5
aws.dynamodb.settings.table.writecapacityunits=5
## Note this is the billing mode for dynamodb. It accepts a enum of type BillingMode which has two values either PROVISIONED or PAY_PER_REQUEST
## Use PAY_PER_REQUEST for unpredicatable workloads. This provisions the resources for any amount data you want to insert or read.
## Use PROVISIONED for predictable workloads where you are sure about the data input. Also if you want to control the cost this is better.
aws.dynamodb.settings.table.billingmode=PAY_PER_REQUEST

aws.dynamodb.settings.file.import=true

## Local or AWS-hosted DynamoDB. Set this flag to true if you want to test ReCiter with DynamoDB local. 
## For more about local hosting, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html
## If you are using an AWS hosted version, those parameters are controlled in the environment 
## variables of your IDE.

#### AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) ####
## This faeture is not yet ruled out with reciter. If you turn this on  uncomment code in /ReCiter/src/main/java/reciter/queue/sqs/AmazonSQSExtendedClientConfig.java
## Usage: toggle to use SQS in front of all DynamoDB operations for efficient request handling.
## Note: Turn this off if you are using dynamodb local
##aws.sqs.use=false
##aws.sqs.region=us-east-1

## Since SQS has a size limit of 256kb. Use if you need additional storage for large messages. 
## BucketName needs to have a *globally* unique name. If it isn't, you'll get an error during the build.
## Note: Turn this off if you are using dynamodb local
##aws.sqs.extendedClient=false
##aws.sqs.s3.bucketName=reciter-queue


#### AWS S3 file storage ####

## Enable S3. Usage: turn on if you expect the item size for DynamoDB to exceed 400kb. This is common.
## BucketName needs to have a *globally* unique name
## Consider naming it like "myInstitution-reciter-dynamodb"
## Note: Turn this off if you are using dynamodb local
aws.s3.use=true
aws.s3.region=us-east-1
aws.s3.dynamodb.bucketName=reciter-dynamodb
## This option might trigger a failed build if set as false since bucket name have to be globally unique. We recommend turning this option true. 
## So reciter will dynamically generate the bucket name following the convention of <aws.s3.dynamodb.bucketName>-<aws.s3.region>-<awsaccountNumber>
aws.s3.use.dynamic.bucketName=false


#### Scopus configuration (optional) ####

## Usage: use Scopus for disambiguated organizations and more complete names.

### Relationship evidence ###

## Goal: use institutionally tracked relationships (e.g., two people are on the same grant) 
## to increase article scores where such individuals' names appear as co-authors on an article.

## For more, see: https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter/wiki/How-ReCiter-works#relationship-evidence

strategy.knownrelationships.relationshipMatchingScore=2.2

## Provide extra credit if first name is exact match.
strategy.knownrelationships.relationshipVerboseMatchModifier=0.6

## Provide extra credit if relationship is of type mentor. Individuals with mentors tend to

## Minimum score for relationship strategy when number of authors is huge and non match is high.

### Grant evidence ###

## Goal: see whether NIH grant IDs from identity.grants match those indexed in articles.

### Education year evidence ###

## Goal: down-weight candidate articles where candidate articles are published relatively early
## in a scholar's academic career as benchmarked against known years of degree.

## For more, see: https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter/wiki/How-ReCiter-works#education-year-evidence

## When before the above year, articles would be expected to be published later in an academic's career.
strategy.discrepancyDegreeYear-DoctoralThreshold1=-6

## When after the above year, articles would be expected to be published earlier in an academic's career.
strategy.discrepancyDegreeYear-DoctoralThreshold2=-13


### Person type evidence ###

## Goal: downweight or upweight individual articles depending on person types in identity.personTypes.
## Upweight individual articles when they come from a small corpus of candidate articles.

## For more, see: https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter/wiki/How-ReCiter-works#person-type-evidence

## Upweight this person type where the person type is "academic-faculty-weillfulltime."
strategy.personTypeScoringStrategy.personTypeScore-academic-faculty-weillfulltime=2

## Downweight this person type.
strategy.personTypeScoringStrategy.personTypeScore-student-md-new-york=-2
 

### Article count evidence ###

## Goal: reward each candidate article in which there are few articles retrieved and penalizes cases
## in which a lot of articles are retrieved. This is consistent with Bayesian insights about probability.

## For more, see: https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter/wiki/How-ReCiter-works#article-count-evidence

## If this number of candidate articles, score for this strategy would be 0.
strategy.articleCountScoringStrategy.articleCountThresholdScore=800

## Increasing this value decreases the weight of this strategy. Decreasing this value, increases the weight.
strategy.articleCountScoringStrategy.articleCountWeight=400
 

### Average clustering evidence ###

## Goal: take advantage of the fact that articles in the same cluster are more likely to be written by the same person.
## For more, see: https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter/wiki/How-ReCiter-works#average-clustering-evidence

## These accepted and rejected scores are only used for clustering and are not included in the 
## individual scores for an article. This is so that users can judge score independently of 
## any feedback.
strategy.acceptedRejectedScoringStrategy.feedbackScore-accepted=3
strategy.acceptedRejectedScoringStrategy.feedbackScore-rejected=-20
strategy.acceptedRejectedScoringStrategy.feedbackScore-null=0
 
## This represents the maximum effect a cluster average can have on the scores of other articles in that cluster.
strategy.averageClusteringScoringStrategy.clusterScore-Factor=0.66

## Increasing the score increases the penalty for having inconsistent first names for the targetAuthor in a 
## given cluster.
strategy.averageClusteringScoringStrategy.clusterReliabilityScoreFactor=3
 

#### Scoring ####

## ReCiter outputs both a raw or non-standardized and standardized scores.
## For more, see: https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter/wiki/How-ReCiter-works#map-article-to-a-standardized-score

## To insulate users from changing raw scores and its non-intuitive range ("How good is 12.1?"), we map the raw score
## to a 1-10 scale. Articles with scores between the 1st and 2nd term in standardizedScoreMapping have a score of 1. 
## Articles with scores between the 2nd and 3rd term in standardizedScoreMapping have a score of 2. Etc.
standardizedScoreMapping=-9999,4,5.5,6.8,7.5,8,9,11,13,15

## If an admin does not select any global score, we default to this score.
totalArticleScore-standardized-default=7
 
## Use this property to set a lower limit for storing ReCiter's output in the "Analysis" DynamoDB table. 
## (Make sure to set aws.s3.use=true, see above, if you wish to store larger objects in s3.)
reciter.minimumStorageThreshold=4
